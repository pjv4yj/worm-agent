  "analysis_summary": "The RansomEXX ransomware group has impacted a wide range of industries, primarily targeting small and medium-sized enterprises. Of the ten victims, only LITEON Technology Corporation is publicly traded, listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TPE). As a foreign issuer, LITEON does not file with the U.S. SEC. The majority of the companies targeted are privately held and span industries such as technology, finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. All attacks resulted in data leaks, indicating a consistent strategy by RansomEXX to monetize both encrypted and stolen data.",
